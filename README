
The Neocognitron is a neural network proposed by Fukushima; it is used for character recognition. This repository contains everything you need to experiment with a basic Neocognitron. This code was created for my final project in Pattern Recognition at RIT.


The organization of this project is as follows:

src     Contains all the source code for the project
data    Contains all the training files needed to run the Neocognitron. Also contains previously saved Neocognitrons.
doc     Complete javadoc for the entire project. Start with doc/index.html 


To run the project, use the executable jar file, Neocognitron.jar.

Use the following command to verify the saved Neocognitron.
java -jar Neocognitron.jar verify

Use the following command to generate your own Neocognitrons. To stop the program, press "ctrl-c".
java -jar Neocognitron.jar
